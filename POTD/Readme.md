## 💡 About

This repository is my collection of solutions for LeetCode’s daily coding problems. Here, I explore various algorithms and data structures by solving real-world coding challenges. Each problem solution includes:
- **Detailed Explanations** for my approach and thought process
- **Alternative Solutions** where applicable
- **Code with Comments** for clarity

By solving problems consistently, I aim to:
- Achieve a deeper understanding of **data structures**
- Optimize solutions using **efficient algorithmic strategies**
- Build a strong **problem-solving mindset** for technical interviews

## 📂 Structure

Each problem solution is stored in its own folder titled after the problem name. Here’s a quick view of the layout:


Each folder contains:
- **README.md**: Describes the problem, approach, and alternative solutions (if any)
- **Solution Files**: Solution implementations in Python, Java, and C++
